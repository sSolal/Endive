# Core Operations Edge Case Tests
# Testing match, apply, compose, reduce with complex patterns

# Test nested pattern matching with composition
Define nested, ([A] | [B]) -> ([A] | [B])
Check nested ~ ([A] | [B]) in context

# Test composition reduces correctly (put in context with B and C)
Define rule1, A -> B
Define rule2, B -> C
Check (A -> B) => ((B -> C) => ((A -> B) | (B -> C))) ~ 
Reduce (A -> B) | (B -> C) ~ A -> C

# Test reduction with identity
Define id, [x] -> [x]
Reduce A | id ~ A

# Test patterns with multiple holes - swap
Define swap, ([a] | [b]) -> ([b] | [a])
Reduce (X | Y) | swap ~ Y | X

# Test deeply nested rewriting
Define three, A -> (B -> C)
Check (A | three) -> (B -> C) ~ (B -> C) in context

# Test complex nested term with function application
Define complex, f([x] | [y]) -> (g([x]) | g([y]))
Reduce f(a | b) | complex ~ g(a) | g(b)

# Test hole matching with complex patterns
Define pattern, ([x] | ([y] -> [z])) -> (([y] -> [z]) | [x])
Reduce (f(abc, de) | ([x] -> (g | [h]))) | pattern ~ [x] -> (g | [h]) | f(abc, de)
