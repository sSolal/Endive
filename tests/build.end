# Build Helper Tests
# Tests for Start, Use, Clear directives and integration with Goal

# Test 1: Basic Start
Define ax1, A => B
Start A ~ Started building from: A

# Test 2: Forward-chaining with Use
Define ax2, B => C
Start A
Use ax1 ~ Applied rule, new term: B

# Test 3: Multiple Use applications
Start A
Use ax1
Use ax2 ~ Applied rule, new term: C

# Test 4: Use without Start (error)
Clear
Use ax1 ~ error # No working term. Use 'Start' first.

# Test 5: Use with non-rewriting (error)
Start A
Use A ~ error # Use requires a rewriting rule

# Test 6: Use with non-matching rule (error)
Define ax3, D => E
Start A
Use ax3 ~ error # Cannot apply ax3 to A

# Test 7: Clear directive
Start A
Clear ~ Working term cleared

# Test 8: Integration with Goal - hybrid proof
Define rule1, X => Y
Define rule2, Y => Z

Goal rule1 => rule2 => (X => Z)
Intro
Intro ~ New goal: [=>X => Z]

# Use forward-chaining to build Z
Start X
Use rule1
Use rule2
Done ~ Goal completed: rule1 => rule2 => X => Z
