            <h2>Why Proof Assistants Matter</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">
                In mathematics and computer science, formal verification provides absolute certainty that a proof or program is correct.
                Proof assistants are powerful tools that help us construct and verify these formal proofs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Proof assistants enable mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verify complex proofs</strong> with machine-checked certainty, eliminating subtle errors that might escape human review</li>
                <li><strong>Build reliable software</strong> by formally proving that programs meet their specifications</li>
                <li><strong>Explore new mathematics</strong> by experimenting with formal systems and discovering patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Teach rigorous reasoning</strong> by making logical steps explicit and transparent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                As mathematical proofs grow increasingly complex and software becomes more critical to society,
                the importance of mechanical verification continues to grow.

            <h2>Rewriting as a Foundation for Reasoning</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">
                Term rewriting is a simple yet powerful computational model that naturally captures the essence of logical reasoning.
            </p>

            <p>
                At its core, rewriting is about transformation: given an object (an expression) and a set of rewritings,
                we can systematically transform that object by applying matching rewritings. This process mirrors how we reason:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "If I know A and I know that A implies B, then I can conclude B."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Rewriting systems offer several advantages for formal reasoning:

                    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
                    <p>Rewritings are intuitive: replace a pattern with another object. This simplicity makes the system accessible while remaining powerful.</p>

            <h2>What is Endive?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Endive is a minimalist proof assistant where you transform mathematical objects using rewriting rules.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                With Endive, you can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build formal proofs</strong> by composing simple rewriting steps</li>
                <li><strong>Verify mathematical statements</strong> through buildability checking</li>
                <li><strong>Compute with symbolic expressions</strong> using pattern matching and reduction</li>
                <li><strong>Explore formal systems</strong> from logic to arithmetic to your own custom theories</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Unlike proof assistants based on type theory or set theory, Endive focuses on term rewriting as the primary
                mechanism for both computation and proof construction. This approach offers a unique perspective on formal verification
                that's both simple to understand and powerful in practice.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pattern matching with holes:</strong> Define rewritings using patterns with variables (holes) that match arbitrary objects</li>
                <li><strong>Buildability checking:</strong> Verify whether an object can be constructed from axioms and rewritings in a given context</li>
                <li><strong>Reduction and computation:</strong> Simplify objects by applying rewritings, enabling both symbolic manipulation and evaluation</li>
                <li><strong>Functoriality:</strong> Apply rewritings within nested structures, allowing proofs to compose naturally</li>
                <li><strong>Syntactic sugar:</strong> Use natural notation for numbers, quantifiers, and logical operators while maintaining a simple core</li>
                <li><strong>Extensible architecture:</strong> Modular helper system allows adding new capabilities while preserving the core engine</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>A Quick Example</h2>
            <p>Here's how you define and use a simple rewriting rule in Endive:</p>

            <pre><code>// Define a rule that constructs logical conjunction
Define def_and, #A => #B => and(#A, #B)

// Declare it as an axiom
Axiom def_and

// Now you can use it to build proofs
Goal and(P, Q)
Intro  // Introduce #A
Intro  // Introduce #B
By def_and</code></pre>

            <p>
                This example shows <strong>holes</strong> (<code>#A</code>, <code>#B</code>) that act as pattern variables,
                a <strong>goal-driven proof</strong> where we work backwards from what we want to prove,
                and how <strong>rewriting rules</strong> transform one expression into another. The <code>Intro</code> directive
                introduces hypotheses, and <code>By</code> applies our rewriting rule to complete the proof.
